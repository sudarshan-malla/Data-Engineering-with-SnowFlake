## Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake

Welcome! This is the companion repository that goes along with Snowflake's **[Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-engineering-snowflake/)** course on Coursera.

#### How to use this repo throughout the course:

To successfully follow along with the instructor during the course, you'll need to make use of the code in this repo. To follow along, you can either:

* Keep the URL to this repo handy, so that you can easily find and use any code referenced by the instructor during the course

* Clone the repo to your local computing environment (recommended)

> **Note:** There are a couple of exercises that make use of Snowflake's command line interface, Snowflake CLI. To successfully follow along during those exercises, you'll need to have the repo cloned to your local computing environment, so that the Snowflake CLI can make use of files and code within this repo.

#### How to clone the repo to your local computing environment:

To clone the repo, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/modern-data-engineering-snowflake.git
```

You can then open the folder in your preferred code editor. Throughout the course, the instructor will use Visual Studio Code as the code editor.

#### How to navigate this repo

All of the code that you need to successfully complete the Coursera code is within this repo. Each folder in this repo corresponds to a module in the online course.

* **module-1** – Corresponds to "Module 1: Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake" in the course.

* **module-2** – Corresponds to "Module 2: Batch Data Ingestion with Snowflake" in the course.

* **module-3** – Corresponds to "Module 3: Data Transformations with Snowflake" in the course.

* **module-4** – Corresponds to "Module 4: Delivering Data Products with Snowflake" in the course.

* **module-5** – Corresponds to "Module 5: Orchestrating Continuous Data Pipelines with Snowflake" in the course.

The course instructor will also be sure to reference the exact folder and name of the file to use throughout the course, so that you can follow along.

#### Reporting issues or errata

If you encounter technical issues or errata as you complete the course (i.e. typos, missing code, broken links, etc.), please report those issues in the course through Coursera, or [open a a new issue in this repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/modern-data-engineering-snowflake/issues/new). Ensure the issue contains sufficient detail so that it can be properly addressed.
